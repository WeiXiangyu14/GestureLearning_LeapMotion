I program a gesture learning system with Unity. It works with the LeapMotion.

This LeapMotion program can help you learn some technical gestures easily.

First you should connect your LeapMotion to your computer.

Then you just need to choose the gesture you want to learn and put your hands above the LeapMotion. 

It can get the location and action of your hands, and send the data to the program.

The program will show you the correct gesture and tell you how to move your fingers and palm to show the gesture prefectly.

It can also check your learning result and remind you to review.

With this program, learning difficult gestures is not that boring and hard.

I think it can be applied in the areas like athletic training, learning musical instruments, simulating experiment operations, etc.
